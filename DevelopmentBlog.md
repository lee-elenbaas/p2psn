Ok, I started a few days after i started this repository.
The initial step was getting the idea strait inside my mind. It is not at all complete yet, but the major theams are already set i my mind.
After deciding that CppCMS is my tool of choice for this project, I decided to sit down and learn it. And came to the conclustion that i need a refresher in C++. I started with some math classes that i think will come in handy in this project, worst case, I learn C++11 this way.
