I been busy learning C++11 as the basis for this project.
And finally got myself a few functions that i think should work well. So now i need to finish the testing framework around it.

I am also attempting to get a friend into this project, i am missing somone to talk to about this.

Ok, I started a few days after i started this repository.
The initial step was getting the idea strait inside my mind. It is not at all complete yet, but the major theams are already set i my mind.
After deciding that CppCMS is my tool of choice for this project, I decided to sit down and learn it. And came to the conclustion that i need a refresher in C++. I started with some math classes that i think will come in handy in this project, worst case, I learn C++11 this way.
